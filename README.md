# GettingStartedWithVR

This is a placeholder for a forthcoming workshop on building Virtual Reality applications with Unity.

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about building VR applications in Unity! Bandwidth at the conference site may be limited, so here's the things you should download and install in advance so you can spend you time *learning* instead of *waiting*. 

Course materials will be posted to this repo, so click the eye icon to "watch" for updates or check back in early November.

## Download Before You Arrive

### 1) Download Unity 2017.1.1f

Unity pushes new releases often and tests new releases with a beta program. This workshop will calibrate to 2017.1.1f so that's the one you should get.

- (Win/Mac) https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal

- (Linux users should use 2017.1.3b1 or higher from http://beta.unity3d.com/download/2ca68d182788/public_download.html)


### 2) Run the Installer
Once you've downloaded Unity, make sure to run the installer and include the desktop systems you want to build for and IOS or Android if you want to do mobile VR development. This will take a long time.  

### 3) Download Supporting Plugins From the Asset Store

From the Unity Asset Store, download these free plugins:

- SteamVR 1.2.2+ https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647 ( or git https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin)

- VRTK 3.2.1+ https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64131 (or git https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK/releases/tag/3.2.1)


### 4) (optionally) Download Any Additional SDKs for Your Hardware

Optionally, download any supporting SDKs for hardware you own and want to develop on:

- for Mobile: get GoogleVR 1.7 https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases/download/1.70.0/GoogleVRForUnity_1.70.0.unitypackage and make sure your Android SDK or XCode are up to date

- for Oculus: get Oculus Utilities 1.18.1 https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-utilities-for-unity-5/ and Oculus Avatar SDK https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-avatar-sdk/

- for Vive: install Steam and SteamVR desktop app https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2001-UXCM-4439#install-steam

### 5) (optionally) Download Tools for Asset Editing

Optionally, download any additional editing tools you might want to have on hand. Here's a few open source tools I like:  

Blender (useful for mesh editing and 3d file conversions)
https://www.blender.org/download/

Audacity (useful for audio editing)
http://www.audacityteam.org/download/

Krita (useful for image editing)
https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/

### 6) (optionally) Pack an External Mouse

Some people prefer using a physical mouse to a trackpad to manipulate 3D scenes - if you have an external mouse you may want to bring it along so you have the option.
